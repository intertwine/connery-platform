## ü§î What is this?

**With Connery, you can create and use plugins across many AI platforms.
Connery will handle the rest: isolated runtime, authorization, secret management, access management,
audit logs, and other [vital features](#-features).**

Many AI platforms are gaining momentum on the market ‚Äî for instance, OpenAI with GPTs,
LangChain, AI-powered chatbots, and agents.

To fully leverage the capabilities of these platforms, it's essential to connect them with the real world:
SaaS applications, APIs, databases, and so on.

While APIs provide a fundamental bridge for connectivity,
they alone aren't sufficient to connect the real world to AI platforms.
The AI platforms require a new type of infrastructure capable of handling plugin-related challenges,
such as authorization, secret management, access management, and other vital features, ensuring robust security and control.

This is where Connery comes into play.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

Connery consists of four main components that tightly work together:

<img alt="Four main components of Connery" src="./apps/docs/static/img/repo/four-main-components-of-connery4.svg">

**Action** - Think of an action as a basic task, something like a function with input and output parameters designed to do one specific thing.
For example, "Send an email" is an action in the ["Gmail"](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) _plugin_.

**Plugin** - This is a collection of related actions grouped together because they serve a similar purpose.
Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository with TypeScript code of a specific structure.
Plugin must be installed on a _runner_ before its actions can be used.

**Runner** - This is the heart of Connery, an open-source application that knows how to handle plugins and run actions.
It's equipped with key features like authentication handling, security, and access management.
Each organization or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique plugin set and configuration.
The runner provides a standardized API for every installed action that can be consumed by _clients_.

**Client** - A client is a specific application for each platform that uses the API provided by the runner.
It's like a translator that adapts the runner's capabilities to fit the platform's needs.
For example, an [OpenAI GPTs](https://docs.connery.io/docs/clients/native/openai/gpt) client allows you to run
Connery actions from OpenAI GPT, or a [Slack](https://docs.connery.io/docs/clients/native/slack) client
will enable you to run Connery actions directly from Slack.

The combination of these components allows you to run actions from any platform supported by Connery. For example, you can use the same Connery action from OpenAI GPT, LangChain, Slack, and [many more](https://docs.connery.io/docs/clients/native/).
