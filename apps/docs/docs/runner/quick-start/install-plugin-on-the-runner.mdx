# Install plugin on the runner

Here, you will learn how to install a plugin on the runner.

## 1. Open and understand the configuration file

Open the runner configuration file `./apps/runner/connery-runner.config.ts` in the codespace.

Among the other configuration parameters, you can see the `installedPlugins` section.
`installedPlugins` is an array of plugin configurations already containing one plugin: `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main`.
This plugin is used to manage the runner, and it's preinstalled on the runner by default.

```ts
...
installedPlugins: [
  {
    key: 'connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main',
    configurationParameters: {
      runenrUrl: 'http://localhost:4201',
      runnerApiKey: process.env.CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY,
    },
  },
],
...
```

Every plugin configuration has the `key` and `configurationParameters` properties.

The `key` is a unique plugin identifier with the following format: `owner/repository@branch`.
As you can see, it directly relates to the GitHub repository where the plugin is stored.
For example, the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` plugin is stored
in the https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration GitHub repository and uses the code from the `main` branch.
The branch is used for versioning and can be replaced with a tag.

The `configurationParameters` is a flat key-value object containing the plugin's configuration parameters.
Configuration parameters are specific for each plugin; you can find them in the plugin definition file in the related GitHub repository.
For example, the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` plugin has the configuration parameters
defined in the `configurationParameters` section of its definition file [index.ts](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration/blob/main/src/index.ts) in the root of the GitHub repository.
The definition file shows that both `runenrUrl` and `runnerApiKey` configuration parameters are required, so they must be provided in the plugin configuration.

The actions of this plugin use the configuration parameters to perform their tasks.

## 2. Add plugin configuration

Let's install the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin on the runner.
It has an action that sends an email using the Gmail API.

:::info Plugin versioning
You can install the plugin from the `main` branch, so you always use the newest plugin code from the main branch.
However, this won't be as stable as the tagged versions. The plugin can be in the development stage on the `main` branch.
When on the tagged version, the code is stable, and once the new version tag is released, the code won't be changed anymore for this version.
You can find the latest version of the plugin in it's repository in the "Releases" section.

For example, for the `connery-io/gmail` plugin, the latest version is `v1.0.2` on the date of writing this article.
We will use this version in the example below.
:::

First, we need to check the plugin definition file [index.ts](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/index.ts) and find the configuration parameters we need to provide.
Based on the definition file, the configuration parameters are:

- `gmailEmailAddress` (required)
- `gmailAppPassword` (required)
- `senderName` (optional)

So let's add the plugin configuration to the end of the `installedPlugins` array in the runner configuration file like the following:

```ts
...
installedPlugins: [
  ...
  {
    key: 'connery-io/gmail@v1.0.2', // NOTE: We use the tagged version v1.0.2 here. However, you can use any other available tagged version or the branch name here.
    configurationParameters:
    {
      gmailEmailAddress: '<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>',
      gmailAppPassword: '<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>',
      senderName: '<SENDER_NAME>'
    }
  }
],
...
```

Replace the `<GMAIL_EMAIL_ADRESS>`, `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>` and `<SENDER_NAME>` placeholders with the actual values.<br/>
Check the [Sign in with app passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) article from Google Support to learn how to generate the app password for your Gmail account.

If the runner is still running in your codespace, the configuration will be automatically applied after saving the file.
On the next API request to the runner, it will download the plugin from the GitHub repository and cache it.

:::info

If you want to install a plugin from the private GitHub repository, configure the Personal Access Token (`GITHUB_PAT`) in the `.env` file.
So the runner can access the private repository and can download the plugin.

:::

If you want to update the installed plugins with the latest changes from their repositories,
run the `ClearPluginCache` action of the `connery-io/connery-runner-administration@main` plugin as was shown [on the previous page](/docs/runner/quick-start/set-up-runner#run-action-using-api).
It will clean the plugins cache on the runner and download the latest version of the plugins from the specified branch or tag.
You don't need to restart the runner after that.

## Next steps

Now, when you have the runner configured and the plugins installed, you can learn how to [use clients](/docs/runner/quick-start/use-clients-to-call-actions) to call actions from the plugins.
