# Set up runner

This page will teach you how to set up runner using GitHub Codespaces.

:::

## 1. Create a codespace

:::info
GitHub Codespaces are [free of charge for 120 hours per month](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts) for personal accounts.
The codespace will stop running after a period of inactivity to safe resources.
[By default, this period is 30 minutes.](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces?tool=webui#about-the-idle-timeout)
:::

Use the link below to create a new GitHub Codespace from the [connery-io/connery](https://github.com/connery-io/connery) repository.
It takes around 2 minutes to create a new codespace, install dependencies, build the project, and prepare everything you need to start the runner.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/connery-io/connery?quickstart=1)

Also, you can use the green **Code** button in the top right corner of the repository, then open the **Codespaces** tab and click **Create codespace on main**.

After the codespace is created, you would need to wait for a few minutes until the commands from the `./.devcontainer/post-start-commands.sh` script are executed.
It will create the `.env` file, install the runner dependencies, and build the project.

## 2. Configure ENV variables

After that, you will see that the `.env` file in the repository's root folder is already created with a unique `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY`.
The runner uses this API Key to protect the API.
You will use it later to configure clients to work with the runner.

Also, we recommend configuring the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file.
Runner uses it for the Natural Language Actions feature to access the OpenAI API and classify the user intent.
You can get it from [your OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
This variable is not required to start the runner. However, some clients based on natural language, like [Slack App](/docs/clients/native/slack), won't work without it.

## 3. Start the runner

Open a new terminal window and run the following command to start the runner.

```
yarn start
```

It will start the runner on port 4201.

## 4. Expose the runner to the internet

Currently, the runner is running in your codespace and is accessible only to you.
In the next steps of this guide, we will configure clients to call the action from your runner.
To make it possible, the runner has to be accessible from the internet.

:::info
Codespaces can expose ports to the internet using the [**Sharing a port**](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#sharing-a-port) feature.
:::

To expose the runner to the internet, follow the steps:

1. Open the terminal in your codespace.
2. Click the **PORTS** tab.
3. Right-click the **Runner (4201)**.
4. Click the **Port Visibility**, then click **Public**.

<p align="center">

    src="/img/set-up-runner/change-port-visibility.png"
    alt="Change port visibility"
  />
</p>

5. Click the copy icon to copy the public URL of your runner to the clipboard.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/set-up-runner/copy-public-runner-url.png"
    alt="Copy public runner URL"
  />
</p>

## 5. Test the runner

Let's test the runner to ensure it's up and running and accessible from the internet.

### List installed plugins

Open a new terminal in your codespace and run the following command:

```
curl '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/plugins' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>' | jq .
```

Replace `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>` with the URL that you copied in the previous step,
and `<CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>` with the value of the `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` variable from the `.env` file.

You should receive a successful response with the list of installed plugins and their actions on the runner.

:::info
By default, the [connery-io/connery-runner-administration](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration) plugin is preinstalled on the runner.
:::

### Identify action using natural language

Here is an example of using Natural Language Actions API to identify action based on the natural language request.

:::info
The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required for the Natural Language Actions feature to work.
If you configure it just now, you must restart the runner to apply the changes.
:::

```
curl '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/identify' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>' \
-d '{
    "prompt": "Please clean plugins cache on the runner."
}' | jq .
```

You should receive a response from the runner with the identified action, its connector, and the list of input parameters.
Once the action is identified, you can run it using the API call from the next step.

### Run action using API

Here is an example of how to run the `refreshPluginCache` action from the [connery-io/connery-runner-administration](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-runner-administration) plugin using API.

```
curl '<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/CAF979E6D2FF4C8B946EEBAFCB3BA475/run' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-api-key: <CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY>' \
-d '{}' | jq .
```

In this particular case, the action does not require any input parameters and does not return any output parameters.

## Next steps

Now, when you have the runner up and running, let's learn how to [install plugin](/docs/runner/quick-start/install-plugin-on-the-runner) on it.
