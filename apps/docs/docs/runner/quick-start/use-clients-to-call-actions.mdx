## General authorization approach

The Runner employs an API Key authorization method.
This requires each client to supply an API Key for accessing the runner's actions.

The procedure for setting up a connection to the runner varies among clients, depending on their unique characteristics, user interfaces, and usage patterns.
However, the fundamental steps are consistent across all clients:
to establish a connection with the runner, you must always input the Runner URL and API Key into the client's configuration settings.

## Configure your first client

You have the freedom to select from a diverse range of clients, including both [native](/docs/clients/native/) and [community-developed](/docs/clients/community) options. Detailed information on each client, including its setup and usage instructions, can be found on their respective documentation pages.

For this tutorial, we suggest beginning with the Slack App client. Slack is widely used and known for its user-friendly interface.

To proceed with the tutorial, please refer to the [Slack App](/docs/clients/native/slack) client documentation page.
