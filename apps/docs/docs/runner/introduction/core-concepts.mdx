# Core concepts

Connery consists of the following four main components that tightly work together.

The combination of these components allows you to run actions from any platform supported by Connery.
For example, you can run the same action from [Slack](/docs/clients/native/slack), [OpenAI GPT](/docs/clients/native/openai/gpt) or [Make](/docs/clients/native/make).

## Action

Think of an action as a basic task, something like a function with input and output parameters designed to do one specific thing.
For example, "Send an email" is an action in the ["Gmail"](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) _plugin_.

:::info Example

[Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts) is an action in
the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin. It has "Recipient", "Subject", and "Body" input parameters.
Once the action is run by the client, it sends an email based on the provided input parameters
and returns a "Message ID" to the client as a result.

:::

## Plugin

This is a collection of related actions grouped together because they serve a similar purpose.
Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository with TypeScript code of a specific structure.
Plugin must be installed on a _runner_ before its actions can be used.

:::info Example

A [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin has a set of actions related to Gmail.
The plugin requires multiple configuration parameters during the installation on the runner
so its actions have access to the Gmail account.

## Runner

This is the heart of Connery, an open-source application that knows how to handle plugins and run actions.
It's equipped with key features like authentication handling, security, and access management.
Each organization or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique plugin set and configuration.
The runner provides a standardized API for every installed action that can be consumed by _clients_.

## Client

A client is a specific application for each platform that uses the API provided by the runner.
It's like a translator that adapts the runner's capabilities to fit the platform's needs.
For example, an [OpenAI GPTs](https://docs.connery.io/docs/clients/native/openai/gpt) client allows you to run
Connery actions from OpenAI GPT, or a [Slack](https://docs.connery.io/docs/clients/native/slack) client
will enable you to run Connery actions directly from Slack.

:::info Example

Connery [Slack App](/docs/clients/native/slack) is a client that allows users to run actions from the runner right
from the Slack workspace using natural language.
