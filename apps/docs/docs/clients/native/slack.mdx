Use natural language to run Connery actions in your [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace when collaborating with your team.

## Demo

Below is an example of how the Connery app helps scale the back-end service on AWS from the Slack channel.

## Information

To use the app, send your message to the app as a direct message using natural language.
Also, you can invite the app to any channel and use it there by mentioning the app in your message.

In the channels, the app can see and respond only to the messages where the app is mentioned.

For every message to the app, it calls Connery API, which
utilizes [OpenAI function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling)
to identify the action and prefill input parameters based on the user's natural language request.
After that, the app shows the action form to the user with prefilled input parameters. So the user can review and change the input parameters, if required, and run the action.
In the end, the app shows the result of the action to the user or an error message if the action failed.
See the demo below in the Usage section.

:::info

To use the app, you must configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`
in the [runner configuration](/docs/runner/quick-start/set-up-runner#2-configure-env-variables)
so the runner can use OpenAI API to classify the user intent to identify the action and prefill input parameters based on the user's natural language request.

Let's install the app in your Slack workspace and configure it to connect to your runner.

## Installation
