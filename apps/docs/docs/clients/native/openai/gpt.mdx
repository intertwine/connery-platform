# OpenAI GPTs

Use Connery actions in your OpenAI GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.

## Demo

See below a demo of how we use Connery's **Send email** action in the GPT to write and send emails.

## Information

OpenAI released a custom version of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose â€” called GPTs.
GPTs provide the ability to deeply customize ChatGPT with all new capabilities.
In addition to using the built-in capabilities, you can also define custom actions by making one or more APIs available to the GPT.
Actions allow GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.
Connect GPTs to databases, plug them into emails, or make them your shopping assistant.

With Connery, you can easily create and manage your own custom actions and use them in your GPTs.
Connery will take care of the action running, authorization, and provide you the OpenAPI specification compatible with OpenAI GPTs.
See below how to set up Connery actions in your GPT.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a Connery runner up and running.
   You can use the [Quickstart](/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide to set it up.
2. Install plugins with actions you want to use in your GPT.
   You can find the list of available plugins in the [Plugins](/docs/plugins/native) page.
   In the demo above, we used the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.
3. Prepare an OpenAI GPT where you want to use Connery actions.

### Set up actions in the GPT

Once you have a Connery runner up and running and the GPT ready, you can add Connery actions to it.

1. **Prepare OpenAPI specification URL** with all the actions installed on your runner

Use the following URL to get the OpenAPI specification: `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>/v1/actions/specs/openapi`.
The `<PUBLIC_RUNNER_URL>` you should get during the runner setup in the [Quickstart](/docs/runner/quick-start/) guide.

Prepare the URL and copy it to use in the next steps.

:::info Runner Public URL is required

OpenAPI specification contains the URL of your runner **to let GPTs know where to send requests**.
Therefore, you need to configure the actual public URL of your runner in the `CONNERY_RUNNER_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file.

If this variable is not set, the OpenAPI URL will respond with error. If the URL is not correct, the GPT will not be able to use Connery actions from your runner.

2. Open the **Configuration** section of your GPT.
3. Scroll down to the **Actions** section and click the **Add actions** button.

    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

4. Click the **Import from URL** button.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-2@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

5. Paste the OpenAPI specification URL you prepared in the previous step into the **URL** field and click the **Import** button.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-3@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

6. Check the list of actions imported from the OpenAPI specification.

:::info Only two actions are imported

There are always two actions imported from the OpenAPI specification: `listActions` and `runAction`.
GPT uses them to get the list of available actions from the runner and to run one of them respectively.
In this way, GPT always has the latest list of actions available on the runner.

7. Click the **Gear** button in the **Authentication** section to configure the authentication method for the actions.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-4@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

8. Select the **API Key** authentication type.
9. Paste the API Key of your runner into the **API Key** field.
10. Select the **Custom** auth type.
11. Use the `x-api-key` as a **Custom Header Name**.
12. Click the **Save** button.

  />
</p>

13. Add the Connery action instructions to the **Instructions** section of your GPT

We recommend adding the following instructions to the end of your instruction in the **Instructions** section of your GPT.
This will help the GPT to understand how to use Connery actions and provide a better experience to the user.

```text
# Instructions on how to use Connery actions:
1. Collect as much input from the user as possible based on the input parameters of the action you will run.
2. Do not come up with the data for the input parameters yourself.
3. Always ask the user for additional input if the data for the required input parameters is missing.
4. Do not ask the user for more data than expected by the input parameters of the action you will run.
```

13. Press **Update** on the top right corner to update the GPT, then press **Confirm** and **View GPT**.

Now, you're ready to use Connery actions in your GPT.
