## Problem

In the workflow of using an AI-powered email assistant, users frequently encounter the inconvenience of manually copying
the generated email text from the assistant and pasting it into their email client.
This process is not only time-consuming but also increases the risk of errors,
disrupting the efficiency and seamless experience that an AI assistant should provide.

## Solution

To streamline this process, we have integrated a feature in our custom OpenAI GPT-powered email assistant
that allows direct email sending through Connery actions.
This enhancement eliminates the need for manual copying and pasting, ensuring a more efficient,
error-free, and user-friendly experience. Users can now compose and send emails directly from the assistant,
significantly boosting productivity and the overall utility of the AI tool.
